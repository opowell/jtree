#### Install jtree

1. Download the latest release of jtree for your system (<a target='_blank' href='https://opowell.github.io/jtree'>opowell.github.io/jtree</a>).

2. Extract the contents of the zip file.

#### Start jtree

3. Make sure jtree is not already running. If it is, close the other copy first (see "Close jtree").

4. Run the server program (double click). The first time running the program you may need to explicitly allow it to run and/or access the network.

5. The administrator window opens automatically in your browser, the server itself opens in a console window in the background.

#### Start a new Session

6. From the Welcome screen, click "Open App..." or "Open Queue...". Press the blue play button next to the App or Queue that you wish to run.

7. Set the number of participants (`Settings` -> `Number of participants`).

8. Click "Start".

For further information about running a session, see <a href='tutorial-3-running-a-session.html'>Running a Session</a>.

#### Close jtree

9. Close the server window.

#### Test your own experiment

10. Place your files in the `apps` folder, then follow the instructions from "Start jtree" again. 

a. If you have a single app, place it directly in the `apps` folder and start it as an App. 

b. If your experiment consists of a series of apps, place them in their own subfolder within `apps`, and start them as a Queue.
