</header>

<article>
    <p>This tutorial describes the sequence of events that happen during a session. In particular, it points out the various functions that can be used to design an app. For more details about this procedure, see the <a href="tutorial-session-flow-details.html">advanced tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>In jtree, participants progress through a session which consists of apps, periods and stages. In doing so, they take the form of players and groups. Broadly speaking, each object calls <code>playerStart</code> (or <code>groupStart</code>) and <code>playerEnd</code> (or <code>groupEnd</code>) whenever a player (or group) begins or finishes that part of the experiment. Designing the logic of the app is simply a matter of overwriting these methods.</p>
<p>This is done in the app's <code>app.js</code> file. This file has access to the <code>App</code> object, from which Stages can be created and customized via the <code>App.newStage(id)</code> function. Periods can be customized by overwriting the <code>App.createPeriod(id)</code> method.</p>
<p>The rest of this tutorial describes approximately the order in which events take place within a session. Due to the option of letting participants progress through different stages without waiting for each other, the actual order of these events may differ in actual sessions.</p>
<p>At the beginning of an app, the following functions are called:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>eval(app.js) // evaluates the contents of app.js
App.participantStart(participant)
// Clients are updated via a &quot;startNewApp&quot; message.
// Participants go through the Periods of the App.
App.participantEnd(participant)</code></pre><p>Within the app, participants go through a series of periods. At the beginning of the period, participants are assigned to a player, and the players are assigned to groups, according to the output of <code>App.getGroupIdsForPeriod(period)</code>. Thus, each period calls the following functions:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>App.getGroupIdsForPeriod(period)
Period.groupStart(group)
Period.playerStart(player)
// Players go through the stages of the app.
Period.playerEnd(player)
Period.groupEnd(group)</code></pre><p>Customizing periods...</p>
<p>Within the period, players and groups progress through the stages of the app. Within each stage, the following functions are called for the groups and players:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>player.status = 'ready'
// If Stage.waitToStart == true, pause here until all players are ready.
Stage.groupStart(group) // Called before any player starts the stage.
player.status = 'playing'
Stage.playerStart(player)
// Players play the stage.
player.status = 'finished'
// If Stage.waitToEnd == true, pause here until all players are finished.
Stage.playerEnd(player)
player.status = 'done'
// Player begins procedure for next stage in session, if any.
Stage.groupEnd(group) // Only called once all players have ended the stage.
// Group begins procedure for next stage in session, if any.</code></pre><p>If <code>Stage.waitToStart</code> is <code>true</code>, no player can start the stage until all players in the group are ready.<br>If <code>Stage.waitToEnd</code> is <code>true</code>, no player can end the stage until all players in the group are finished.<br>As soon as a player ends the stage, they move to the next stage in the session (if there is one) and begin again at the first step of this procedure.</p>
<p>Groups belong to Periods. This means that whenever a stage has <code>waitToStart</code> as false, groups can &quot;start&quot; that stage before finishing one or more of the group's previous stages.</p>
