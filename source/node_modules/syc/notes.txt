Accessing Initial data is clunky right now. List can be a promise.

√  There is a bug in recursive watchers/verifiers. If there are two paths to a descendant and one is removed, it will be unwatched. It should only unwatch when both paths are removed.

√  Unwatching should have the object be the non-optional. Remove all watchers from that object. Will have weird interactions with recursive watchers.

√  Add the socket parameter for watchers on the client side. For consistency.

Groups. Integrate serving into groups. 

X  Can Describe Recursive be simplified so it utilized Describe? It's redundant imo. - I don't think so. Resolve works seamlessly when you provide the recursively constructed data structure. Putting it into Describe probably won't reduce lines of code.

O  I bet the polyfill can be simplified to use the Ancestor function. It might be tricky because multiple Syc variables can reference eachother. - There's currently a bug where if you call Ancestors after creating an object and before the polyfill picks it up, it will error.

Also, the pipeline for sending/receiving data is kinda wonky. I'll look into it.

I'm going to have to get some sort of testing done with this.
